<p class="text-center">Rimuru Bot is a self-run discord bot made with the <a href="https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot"> RedBot</a> framework. <br> Currently there
    are no extra cogs that have been added to the bot, however this website will serve as a place to drop suggestions for the bot;
    which I will approach as coding challenges as I continue to learn more about Discord's API, JS, Python; and related tools.<br>
    Message orion#0003 on discord for access to the bot.
